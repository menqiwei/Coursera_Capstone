The purpose of this project is making predictions of the severity of accident based on some attributes like weather and the road condition. This prediction can offer a reference for drivers about the possibility of getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that they would drive more carefully or even change the travel."

These models can be very useful in helping drivers and polices to avoid potential accidents. For example, , if the possibility of injury accident is high, the driver should be vigilant when driving, the goverment can make warning signs in high accident area, it also give a reference about how should we optimize the road planing and traffic system to avoid accidents, for example, change some road to one direction, build sidewalks etc. In summary, this is a meaningful study for protecting the safety of our lives and properties, hope everyone drive safely on the road."
