The purpose of this project is to make predictions of the severity of accidents based on some attributes like weather and road conditions. This prediction can offer a reference for drivers about the possibility of getting into a car accident and how severe it would be so that they would drive more carefully or even change the travel."

These models can be very useful in helping drivers and police to avoid potential accidents. For example, if the possibility of an injury accident is high, the driver should be vigilant when driving, the government can make warning signs in high accident area, it also gives a reference about how should we optimize the road planning and traffic system to avoid accidents, for example, change some road to one direction, build sidewalks, etc. In summary, this is a meaningful study for protecting the safety of our lives and properties, hope everyone drive safely on the road."
